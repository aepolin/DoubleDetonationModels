# NebularModels

These are the models from: 
"Nebular Models of Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Type Ia Supernovae: Clues to the originof Ca-rich transients"
Polin, A., P. E. Nugent, and D. Kasen
Submitted to ApJ on 27 October 2019.  arXiv e-prints, arXiv:1910.1243

File titles are in the form: "{MWD}_{MHe}_doubledet_{daysfromexplosion}spectrum.dat", and the data columns are #wavelength, flux


Please cite the above work if you would like to use these models. If you have a new event that you think might be a double detonation I would be happy to run you a custom model. Please email me at: abigail@caltech.edu
