# NebularModels

These are the models from: 
"Nebular Models of Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Type Ia Supernovae: Clues to the origin of Ca-rich transients"
Polin, A., P. E. Nugent, and D. Kasen
The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 906, Issue 1, id.65, 11 pp. (2021).
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...906...65P/abstract

File titles are in the form: "{MWD}\_{MHe}\_doubledet\_{daysfromexplosion}spectrum.dat", and the data columns are #wavelength, flux


Please cite the above work if you would like to use these models. If you have a new event that you think might be a double detonation I would be happy to run you a custom model. Please email me at: abigail@caltech.edu
