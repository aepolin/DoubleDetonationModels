These are the models from: 
"Observational Predictions for Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Explosions: Further Evidence for Multiple Progenitor Systems for Type Ia Supernovae"

File titles are in the form: "{MWD}\_{MHe}\_doubledet..."


Please cite the above work if you would like to use these models. If you have a new event that you think might be a double detonation I would be happy to run you a custom model. Please email me at: abigail@caltech.edu
